## What you need

You need your (number)-character reference number. This reference will always be made up of xx numbers and xx characters (for example, xxxx).

You can find this on xxx.

If you use an incorrect reference number:

* there will be a delay in the payment being allocated correctly
* you will receive a payment reminder
