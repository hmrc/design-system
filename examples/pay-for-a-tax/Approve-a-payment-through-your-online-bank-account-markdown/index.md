## Approve a payment through your online bank account

You can pay by approving a payment through your online bank account by selecting the ‘pay by bank account’ option.

You will be directed to sign in to your online or mobile banking account to approve your payment.

The payment is usually instant but can sometimes take up to 2 hours to show in your account.
