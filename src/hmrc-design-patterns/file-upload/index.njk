<p class="govuk-body">The file upload pattern lets users upload files to an HMRC service.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Use this pattern when users must upload a file to complete their journey.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-not-to-use">When to not use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Do not use this pattern if there is no need for users to upload a file, or no good reason to ask for one. The interaction of uploading a file can be challenging for some users.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

{{ hmrcFrontendInfo() }}

<p class="govuk-body">How it works depends on whether the user needs the option to upload more than one file.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Let users select a single file">Let users upload a single file</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/file-upload/">file upload component</a> to let users upload a single file.</p>

{{
  example({
    item: 'file-upload',

    description: 'Let users upload a single file'
  })
}}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="let users select additional files">Let users upload additional files</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">If users need the option to upload more than one file, include an additional screen asking if they want to upload another.</p>

{{
  example({
    item: 'file-upload',
    example: 'upload-additional-files',
    description: 'Let users upload additional files'
  })
}}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Accept multiple file types">Accept multiple file types</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Let users upload as many different file types as possible. Convert them automatically, if you need to.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you must limit file types, let users know by using hint text.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Upload in progress">Upload in progress</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Show the user that their file is being uploaded.</p>

{{
