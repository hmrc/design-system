<p class="govuk-body">
  These are patterns designed specifically for the needs of HMRC users and patterns that are not yet in the GOV.UK Design System.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> to see if the component or pattern you need is already being used across government.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  If you cannot find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System or the HMRC design patterns, you can:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/upcoming-components-patterns/">see if it is being worked on by other teams across government and add your findings</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="/hmrc-design-patterns/hmrc-design-patterns-backlog">see if it is being worked on by HMRC and add your findings</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues/new">propose a new pattern</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  All patterns must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#proposing-a-component-or-pattern">contribution criteria</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
  Using code snippets in prototypes
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Each pattern includes coded examples. You will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="/hmrc-design-patterns/install-hmrc-frontend-in-your-prototype/">install HMRC Frontend</a> to use patterns with specific HMRC code not yet supported by the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. You must use version 7 or later of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit for these to work.
