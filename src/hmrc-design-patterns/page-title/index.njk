<p class="govuk-body">The page title is the text displayed in the browser tab. It is the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> not the <a class="govuk-link" href="/hmrc-design-patterns/page-heading">page heading</a> or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Use a unique page title on every page.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The page title can have 3 or 4 items separated by dashes. They are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the same &lt;h1&gt; as the page</li>
  <li>section name, which you should only include if the service has more than one section</li>
  <li>service name</li>
  <li>GOV.UK</li>
</ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="using-the-gov-uk-protype-kit">Using the GOV.UK Prototype kit</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">Change your page title by updating the default <code>page_title</code> block on each page.</p>

  {{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '
{% block page_title %}
  Do you live in the UK? – Your details – Manage your tax credits – GOV.UK
{% endblock %}',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

  <p class="govuk-body">For pages that use HTML, edit the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> on each page.</p>

  {{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '<title>Do you live in the UK? – Your details – Manage your tax credits – GOV.UK<title>',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

  <p class="govuk-body">
    If the user makes an error, add ‘Error: ’ to the beginning of the title so screen readers read it out as soon as possible.
  </p>

  {{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '<title>Error: Do you live in the UK? – Your details – Manage your tax credits – GOV.UK<title>',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="personally-identifiable-information">Personally identifiable information</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">If there is personally identifiable information in the &lt;h1&gt;, you must make sure it is not recorded in your analytics package.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">For example, if the &lt;h1&gt; is ‘What is Gordon's date of birth?’, record ‘What is their date of birth?’.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">To do this you could change the page title to use ‘their’ but keep ‘Gordon’ in the &lt;h1&gt;. Or you could keep ‘Gordon’ in the page title and send a different page title to your analytics package.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="research">Research</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">This guidance is based on the format recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/G88">Providing descriptive titles for Web pages</a>.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It is more accessible and is consistent with GOV.UK guidance pages.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">All users will be able to use the title to know:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>what page they are on</li>
  <li>where that page is inside a service</li>
  <li>they are still on GOV.UK</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">We need more research. If you have used the page title, get in touch to share your research findings.</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues/90">Discuss the page title on GitHub</a></p>
