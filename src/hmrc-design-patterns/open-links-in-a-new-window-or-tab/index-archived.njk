<p class="govuk-body">This pattern lets the user open links in a new window or tab.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">First, design your service so that links open in the same window or tab and test with users.
  Research shows that some users struggle to get back to a service because the back button does not work in the new
  window or tab.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Only use this pattern if opening a link in a new window or tab meets a user need or is necessary
  to use the service. This could be because:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the link is to a document in a different format, like a PDF</li>
  <li>the link is to guidance that cannot be inside the service</li>
  <li>the user would lose their details if they left the service</li>
  <li>the user needs to go to another site or service to get information</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-not-to-use">When not to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Do not use if opening a link in a new window or tab:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>does not meet a user need</li>
  <li>leads to more than one window or tab open within the same service</li>
  <li>stops the user completing their task</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Always put ‘(opens in a new window or tab)’ inside the link text content.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">In the code include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code> to open in a new window or tab</li>
  <li><code>rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;</code> to reduce security risks for some browsers</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Do not use any icons in place of the words. See ‘<a class="govuk-link"
                                                                          href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/28/removing-the-external-link-icon-from-gov-uk/">Removing
