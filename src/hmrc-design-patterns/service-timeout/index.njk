<p class="govuk-body">This pattern warns the user before we time them out of a service and tells them what has happened when we do time them out.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">We time the user out when they do not do anything for 15 minutes. Warn them after 13 minutes, which gives them 2 minutes to decide to keep using the service.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Use an accessible dialog box that appears on top of the page. This stops them using the screen with a mouse or keyboard until they select an option or press the escape key.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The user can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>select a button to stay in the service and not time out</li>
  <li>select a link to sign out or have their answers deleted</li>
  <li>press the escape key to close the warning, stay in the service and not time out</li>
  <li>do nothing</li>
</ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="when-the-user-is-signed-in">When the user is signed in</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">The warning should:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>say ‘For your security, we will sign you out in 2 minutes.’</li>
    <li>say what will happen to their answers, if needed</li>
    <li>have a ‘Stay signed in’ button</li>
    <li>have a ‘Sign out’ link that signs them out as normal</li>
  </ul>

  <li>set focus to the box</li>
  <li>read the paragraph of content</li>
  <li>set focus to the button</li>
  <li>read the button label</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">This lets the user hear what they need to and stay in the service with a single click.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="research">Research</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The warning was tested with 5 users for a service they signed in to. One person had dyslexia and the other was 70 years old. All 5 users understood the warning and managed to stay signed in.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We want to do more usability testing, especially with users who use assistive technology and with services you do not sign in to.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We want to know if users:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>understand what has happened</li>
  <li>understand the content and if there is anything missing</li>
  <li>can do what they need to do – stay signed in, continue with the service, sign out, start again, or get timed out</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The warning has been tested with all recommended browsers. It has been lab tested with most assistive technology including:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>JAWS</li>
  <li>ZoomText</li>
  <li>NVDA</li>
  <li>VoiceOver on MacOS and iOS</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">It has not been tested with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We need more research. If you have used service timeout, get in touch to share your research findings.</p>
