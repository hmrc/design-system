<p class="govuk-body">Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to HMRC Design Patterns. You can propose a new pattern, or suggest an improvement to an existing one.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">These are patterns designed specifically for the needs of HMRC users. If you want to propose a new pattern for use across government, or suggest an improvement to an existing one, use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/">GOV.UK Design System community backlog</a>.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Patterns in the backlog may be:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Proposed</span> – someone has suggested a new pattern</li>
  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">To do</span> – the proposed pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on</li>
  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">In progress</span> – someone is actively working on the pattern</li>
</ul>
