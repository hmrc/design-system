<p class="govuk-body">
  This pattern lets the user enter a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR). Do not call it a ‘Unique Taxpayer Reference number’.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">
  When to use
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Use this pattern when the user must enter a UTR to use a service.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  If there is a good reason for asking for a UTR but the user does not have to enter one, make it optional.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-not-to-use">
  When not to use
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  If there is no good reason for asking for a UTR and the user does not have to enter one to use the service, do not ask for one.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-it-works">
  How it works
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You can ask for the UTR as the main heading or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> of the screen. It may be a question or statement.
</p>

{{
  example({
    item: 'unique-taxpayer-reference',
    example: 'self-assessment',
    welsh: 'self-assessment-welsh',
    description: 'Unique Taxpayer Reference - Self Assessment'
  })
}}

{{
  example({
    item: 'unique-taxpayer-reference',
    example: 'corporation-tax',
    welsh: 'corporation-tax-welsh',
    description: 'Unique Taxpayer Reference - Corporation Tax'
  })
}}

<p class="govuk-body">
  Or you can ask for the UTR as a normal form label, separate from the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.
</p>

{{
  example({
    item: 'unique-taxpayer-reference',
    example: 'label',
    welsh: 'label-welsh',
    description: 'Employer PAYE reference as form label'
  })
}}

<p class="govuk-body">
  Use a single text input and allow the user to enter:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>10 numbers, with or without spaces</li>
  <li>13 numbers, with or without spaces</li>
  <li>10 or 13 numbers that start or end with a k, for example k1234567890123 and 1234567890k</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Remove spaces, characters and extra numbers before validating.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="provide-contextual-help">
  Provide help
</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Always provide help in the form of a label, normal content or hint text that is as clear as possible. This may include:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a short explanation of what a UTR is</li>
  <li>where they can find it</li>
  <li>what it looks like</li>
  <li>an example – if you show an example, always use ‘1234567890’</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You can use an image that shows where it is on documents and letters. You could also provide a link to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-utr-number">Find a lost UTR number</a>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Do not use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/">details component</a> to hide any help. Research shows users may:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>not know what a UTR is</li>
  <li>need help to know what a UTR looks like</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Ask the user about the type of business earlier in the journey and use appropriate content. For example, if the business is a sole trader, tell the user they can find their UTR on letters about Self Assessment. If the business if a limited company, tell the user they can find it on letters about Corporation Tax.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="error-messages">
  Error messages
</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Error messages should be styled like this:
</p>

{{
  example({
    item: 'unique-taxpayer-reference',
    example: 'label-error',
    welsh: 'label-error-welsh',
    description: 'Employer PAYE reference with error'
  })
}}

<p class="govuk-body">
  Make sure errors follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/">guidance about error messages</a> in the GOV.UK Design System and have specific error messages for specific error states.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="utr-empty">
  If the UTR is empty
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Say ‘Enter [whatever it is]’.<br>
  For example, ‘Enter your Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer Reference’.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="utr-wrong-format">
  If the UTR is in the wrong format
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Say ‘Enter [whatever it is] in the correct format’.<br>
  For example, ‘Enter your partnership’s Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer Reference in the correct format’.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="research">
  Research
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Research has shown that users often expect this kind of information to be pre-populated, especially when they have signed in. Research has also shown users:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>may not know what a UTR is</li>
  <li>need help to know what their UTR looks like</li>
  <li>need a specific error message so they know what went wrong</li>
  <li>find their UTR more easily when we provide help appropriate to the type of business</li>
</ul>
