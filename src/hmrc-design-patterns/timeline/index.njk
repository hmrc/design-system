  This pattern helps users view a linear record of what’s happened.

<p class="govuk-body">
Use the Timeline pattern to show information that is ordered by time to let users know about the history of an item, such as a case or payment.

When not to use

<p class="govuk-body"> Do not use the timeline pattern if you need to let users know where they are in a journey. In this case, consider another approach. </p>

  How it works

<p class="govuk-body">Each item in the timeline should have:</p>
 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" role="list">
<li> a title</li>
<li>date or time</li>
<li>description (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research" class="govuk-heading-l">Research</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">

The pattern is used in the VAT repaymeents service and was tested with 7 users across 3 rounds. Research has shown that users:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" role="list">
<li> understood that events were connected to one another on a timeline, with one event following another </li>
<li> easily identified that the top event was the most recent;</li>
<li>on smaller screens had a similar experience to those on larger devices</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
We need more research. If you have used the Timeline pattern, get in touch to share your research findings.
