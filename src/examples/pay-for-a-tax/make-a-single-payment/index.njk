<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Making a single payment</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
You’ll need to set up a payment each time you pay HMRC. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
You should set up the payment at least:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>5 working days before your return due date (the first time you do it)</li>
<li>3 working days before your return due date if you use the same bank details as a previous single payment</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
The payments will show on your bank statement as ‘HMRC NDDS’.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Paying your bill automatically</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
HMRC will automatically collect the payment from your bank account based on the amount in your return. You’ll only need to set the Direct Debit up once. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Set it up at least 4 working days before your payment due date.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
The payments will show on your bank statement as ‘HMRC SDDS’.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Payments will be automatically collected from your bank account. This is usually 4 days after your return and payment due date. We will send you a message with the exact date and amount after you file your return.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If you file your return late, your payment will usually be taken 4 days after you file the return.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
The Direct Debit cannot collect any interest or penalty charges you owe.
</p>
