## Pay at your bank or building society

You can make payment at your own branch, by cash or cheque or cash.

You must:

* use the paying-in slip sent by HMRC
* make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’ and write your 11-character payment reference number on the back

If you pay from Monday to Friday HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it, not the date it reaches their account.
