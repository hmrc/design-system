<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to pay</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Payments are due within 14 days of the ‘effective’ transaction date. This is usually the date the transaction is completed, but it can also be the date:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the purchaser is entitled to take possession of the property</li>
<li>the first rent payment is due</li>
<li>of substantial completion — when at least 90% of the payment (or other exchange) is made</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the deadline is on a weekend or bank holiday, make sure your payment reaches HMRC by the end of the previous working day.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If you do not pay by the deadline, you may need to pay a penalty, interest or both.
