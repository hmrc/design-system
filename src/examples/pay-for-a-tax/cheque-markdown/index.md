Allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HMRC.

Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’ and write your reference number on the back.

Do not fold the cheque or attach it to other papers.

If you’re sending a cheque for more than one unique transaction reference, you should send a list of all the references against each payment amount.

You can include a letter to ask for a receipt.
