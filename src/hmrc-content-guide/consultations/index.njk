<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Summary of responses</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">There are 2 stages to a consultation response:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>public feedback</li>
<li>final outcome</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Usually HMRC only publishes the final outcome, with the document summarising both what the feedback was, and what the next steps will be.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Summary of responses should be published on the original consultation page. </p>
