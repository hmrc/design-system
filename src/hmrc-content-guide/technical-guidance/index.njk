<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this pattern where the majority of the users are tax agents or professionals who need the really complex guidance to deal with their clients affairs.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Please send a request to Editorial Board before you start using this pattern, with an explanation about why you think this pattern is right for the content youâ€™re designing.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How it works</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Structure</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
A collection that contains the items detailed below.
</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>A single detailed guide designed to help users (especially unrepresented taxpayers):
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>understand the basics of the subject</li>
    <li>decide if this affects them</li>
    <li>understand any tasks they might complete themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional detailed guides or publications that:
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>have clear titles and summaries and meet minimal GOV.UK standards</li>
    <li>cover all the different tasks or topics that tax agent / specialist users may need</li>
    <li>provide the detail and use technical terminology specialist users will expect</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this pattern when there's a tight deadline</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
You must always insist on the creation of the basic detailed guide for unrepresented users. This should be as brief and high-level as possible to reduce the effort required to fact check it.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
But to help meet a very tight deadline, you can create a single additional publication which:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>is created from the source content provided by the business</li>
    <li>must have a title which makes it clear that it is for the more specialist user</li>
    <li>can (initially) be published without editing to meet GOV.UK standards - so that fact checking will not be necessary</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
This exception should only be used after gaining agreement from the business to work with you after initial publication to create the multiple detailed guides / publications this patterns requires.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you need to change this pattern</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You should send a request to the Editorial Board if you need to change this pattern.
</p>
