<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this component to introduce content that has force of law (sometimes referred to as tertiary legislation) in <a href="https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-content-guide/notices/" class="govuk-link">excise, Soft Drinks Industry Levy or VAT notices</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to use this component</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Where possible write force of law in plain English in collaboration with the Solicitor&#39;s Office to make sure it’s
legally correct.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How it works</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this component just before the text that has force of law.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Force of law text should be put at the point the user needs to know it to complete their task.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Option 1</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this option where all of the text that sits under a heading has force of law.
