<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use a detailed guide</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
You will normally use a <a href="/hmrc-content-guide/forms-detailed-guide/" class="govuk-link">detailed guide</a> when: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the form is an alternative way to complete a task (and the main way to complete the task is covered in a detailed guide)</li>
<li>when we want the user to read guidance about the task before they complete the form</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use a publication</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
You will normally use a <a href="/hmrc-content-guide/forms-publication/" class="govuk-link">publication</a> when:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the form could be used and linked to from multiple pieces of guidance</li>
<li>the form may be used multiple times by the same user and that the priority is getting access to the form, rather than any guidance that may sit around it</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not use a publication if you need the users to read any information on the page before they access the form.
