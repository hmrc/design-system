You will normally use a <a href="/hmrc-content-guide/forms-detailed-guide/" class="govuk-link">detailed guide</a> when: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the form is an alternative way to complete a task (and the main way to complete the task is covered in a detailed guide)</li>
<li>when we want the user to read guidance about the task before they complete the form</li>
<li>the form is the way a user completes the task covered in the detailed guide</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
You will normally use a <a href="/hmrc-content-guide/forms-publication/" class="govuk-link">publication</a> when:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the form could be used and linked to from multiple pieces of guidance</li>
<li>the form may be used multiple times by the same user and that the priority is getting access to the form, rather than any guidance that may sit around it</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not use a publication if you need the users to read any information on the page before they access the form.

But in most cases a detailed guide will give you more flexibility to create a better experience for users. For example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-access-customs-handling-of-import-and-export-freight-c1800" class="govuk-link">Apply to access Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (C1800)</a>.
