<p class="govuk-body">Use this pattern to tell users about a change in import or export procedures.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How it works</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You do not need to mention 'import' or 'export' unless really necessary, as anti-dumping duty only apply to imports into the UK and EU.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Publication</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Title</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Description (only include the object or item and where it’s imported from or describe what the measure is about and the measure number in brackets at the end).</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Check the anti-dumping duty measures collection to make sure your title has not already been used in a recent measure.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Examples of good titles:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>Hand pallet trucks imported from China (anti-dumping duty xxxx)</li>
<li>Name change of a company that exports ceramic tableware and kitchenware from China (anti-dumping duty xxxx)</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Summary</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Provide a short description of what the attached document is about.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Do not start your summary with 'Find out'.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  For example, ‘Changes to the duty codes for trucks with a weight indicative system, originating in the
  People’s Republic of China’.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Details</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Enter this text:</p>

  {{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 'Anti-dumping duty is an import duty charged in addition to normal Customs Duty and is applied in the UK and across the whole EU.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">HTML attachment</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Although measures contain technical information you should be able to get a general understanding about what they are for - go back to the subject matter expert if you think a measure does not make sense or is unclear.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Check any hyperlinks in the business draft. Contact the subject matter expert to get correct details if any links:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>point to the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html" class="govuk-link">home page of the EurLex website</a>, rather than the page containing the relevant legislation</li>
<li>go directly to a PDF (or other file), rather than the webpage that houses it</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Title</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Use the same title as the publication.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Body text</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Enter the contents of the anti-dumping duty measure.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Collection page</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Make sure you add the new measure to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/anti-dumping-duty-measures" class="govuk-link">anti-dumping duty measures</a> document collection. Do not create a public change note.
