<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Use this pattern to design an excise, Soft Drinks Industry Levy or VAT notice that includes force of law - for examples see:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197">Receive goods into and remove goods from an excise warehouse</a> (Excise Notice 197)</li>

</ul>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>use call to action markdown to indicate force of law text</li>
<li>amend or style any force of law text</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Formatting can be carried out to 'force of law' text to meet accessibility as long as it doesn't change any of the wording or meaning.</p>
