<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this pattern if users only need to read brief information before they complete the form, such as:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>if they can save their progress</li>
<li>where to send the form</li>
<li>contact information for help and advice</li>
<li>if they need to fill in the form online or print it to complete it</li>
<li>how to sign in to a service</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
Types of form that can be included in this format are: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>PDFs that cannot be completed on screen (not interactive) — these are added as file attachments and do not require Adobe to open</li>
<li>LC forms — these are added as external link attachments and the URL will begin with: https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/</li>
<li>G-forms — these are added as external link attachments and the URL will begin with: https://tax.service.gov.uk</li>
<li>forms in .ods format — these are added as file attachments</li>
<li>KANA forms — these are added as external link attachments and the URL will begin with: https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
More than one type of form can be hosted on the publication page. 
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="not">When not to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not use this pattern if:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>we need to give users detailed guidance that they need to know before using the form</li>
<li>the form is a PDF that can be completed on-screen (interactive), meaning they require Adobe to open and complete</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
If this applies, you should use a <a href="/patterns-hmrc-govuk-team/forms-detailed-guide" class="govuk-link">detailed guide format</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how">How to design using this pattern</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Document type</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
Publication: form (with a file or external link attachment)
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="publication">Publication</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Title</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
Decide if the title should focus on the action a user needs to take or the name of the
form. This will depend on how users will find and navigate to the form.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Try to avoid including the form number.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Summary</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
If there’s a form number you should include it. For example, ‘Register your business for VAT if you’re distance selling into Northern Ireland using
form VAT1A.’
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="details">Details</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
Include a short summary of when to use the form, including links to any related guidance in a call to action box.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the form is applicable in Wales, but is not translated, include the following at the bottom of the details section:
</p>

  {{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 'Email HMRC to [ask for the form in Welsh](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/welsh-language-helplines#email).',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<p class="govuk-body">
If the form is translated into Welsh, you do not need to include this, but you must create a Welsh version of the entire page to host the Welsh form.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="attachment">Attachment</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
When adding or updating a form, add the form name or number as the ‘unique reference’ in Whitehall. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not select ‘Attachment is accessible’ — the attachment must always have the ‘not suitable for assistive technology’ callout.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="title">Title</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
Specify how the user is submitting the form rather than what the form is for. For example: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>Apply by email</li>
<li>Apply using a print and post form</li>
<li>Apply online</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="accessibility">Accessibility statement</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
You do not need to include this for forms in ods, G-forms or PDFs that you cannot complete on screen.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
For any other formats, you must:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>add an external link attachment directly below the form</li>
<li>use the following URL for the external link attachment: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-statement-for-hmrc-interactive-forms" class="govuk-link">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-statement-for-hmrc-interactive-forms</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Copy this text for an external link attachment in English:</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 'Read the accessibility statement for HMRC forms.',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

  <p class="govuk-body">Copy this text for an external link attachment in Welsh:</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: 'Darllenwch y datganiad hygyrchedd ar gyfer ffurflenni CThEF (yn agor tudalen Saesneg).',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="pdfs-cannot">PDFs that cannot be completed on screen</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These are PDFs that must be printed before they can be completed. They do not require Adobe. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
These do not need any specific instructions for the user.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the address to send the form is not included on the form itself, copy this text in the details section:
</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: '## Where to send the form

$A

$A',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="LC-forms">LC forms</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These forms are hosted on: https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/ 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
The user will fill these forms online and then print and post them. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Copy this text in the details section:
</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: '## How to use the print and post form

You will fill this form in online and you cannot save your progress. It is best to get all of your information together before you start.',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<p class="govuk-body">
If the address to send the form is not included on the form itself, copy this text in the details section:
</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: '## Where to send the form

$A

$A',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<p class="govuk-body">
Check with the subject matter expert if you need to include the following text in the details section:
</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: 'If the form does not open, [contact online services for more help](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/online-services-helpdesk).',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="g-forms">G-forms</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These forms are hosted on: https://www.tax.service.gov.uk 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the URL includes ‘fill-online’, check the guidance page this links to and avoid any repetition. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use the following markdown in the details section if users need their sign in details:
</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: '## How to use the online form

You will need to sign in to use this form. If you do not already have sign in details, you will be able to create them.',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<p class="govuk-body">
Use the following markdown in the details section if users can also sign in with their email address:
</p>

  {{
      codeSnippet({
        code: '## How to use the online form

You’ll need to apply using one of the following::

* sign in details (you can create these if you do not have them)

* an email address',
        canCopy: true
      })
    }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ods">Forms in .ods format</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These do not need any specific instructions for the user.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="kana">KANA forms</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These do not need any specific instructions for the user.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
These forms are hosted on: https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
For example: <a href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/shortforms/form/AAG1_N?dept-name=&sub-dept-name=&location=35&origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Disclosure Of Avoidance Scheme - form AAG1</a>
