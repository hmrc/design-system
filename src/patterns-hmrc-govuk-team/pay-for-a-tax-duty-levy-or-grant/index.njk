The EU rate includes the following countries:

- Austria

- Cyprus
- Estonia
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Greece
- Ireland
- Italy
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Malta

You should only use the EU rate for conversion of invoices drawn in the euro. Do not confuse it with the euro rate published for Agricultural Levy purposes or the bit error rate (BER) daily rate set to help payment of taxes in the euro.
