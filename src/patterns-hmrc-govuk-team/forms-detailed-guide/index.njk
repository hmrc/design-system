<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this pattern if users need to read detailed guidance before they complete a form, such as:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>how to use the form</li>
<li>when to use the form</li>
<li>eligibility criteria</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Detailed examples">Check for duplicate guidance first</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
Before you create the new detailed guide or add the form pattern to an existing guide, check if any of the information is already somewhere else, for example in mainstream content or a specialist guide. If it is, do not repeat it, insert a link instead.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If it is, do not repeat it. Add a link and journey to that content instead.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Detailed examples">Types of forms</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
Types of form that you can use in a detailed guide include the following: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li><strong>Online services</strong> — these are built by service teams on the tax platform behind the Government Gateway, accessed with a green button. The URL, starts with ‘https://www.taxservices.gov.uk/’ often followed by ‘/digital-forms/form/form-name’.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive guidance (IG) forms</strong> — these are built by the interactive guidance team. You can use a green button unless an online service is already on the page. The URL usually starts with https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/guidance. </li>
<li><strong>Interactive PDFs that can be completed on-screen</strong> — these are added as file attachments and need Adobe to open and complete. The URL usually starts with https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/.</li>
<li><strong>PDFs that cannot be completed on screen</strong> — these are added as file attachments and do not require Adobe to open</li>
<li><strong>LC forms</strong> — these are added as external links. The URL will begin with https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content</li>
<li><strong>G-forms</strong> — a common alternative to an online service usually accessed with a green button.  The URL will begin with https://tax.service.gov.uk/submissions.</li>
<li><strong>Open document forms</strong> — these are forms in .ods or odt. Format that are added as file attachments.</li>
<li><strong>KANA forms</strong> — these are added as external links. The URL will begin with https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
More than one type of form can be hosted on the same page. You can still only use the green button once on the page (check the <a href="/patterns-hmrc-govuk-team/green-button/" class="govuk-link">green button pattern</a> for more information).
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Detailed-examples">Forms in a detailed guide examples</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-tax-refund-if-youve-stopped-work-and-flexibly-accessed-all-of-your-pension-p50z" class="govuk-link">Claim a tax refund if you've stopped work and flexibly accessed all of your pension (P50Z)</a> —  online service with a green button, an interactive guidance (print and post) form, and a PDF (print and post) form for digitally excluded users</li>

<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-a-non-resident-company-who-disposed-of-uk-property-or-land-for-corporation-tax" class="govuk-link">Apply as an individual to receive rental income without UK tax deducted</a> — online service and LC print and post form</li>

</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-not-to-use">When not to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not use this pattern if users do not need to read any detailed guidance before using the form, and only need to:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>check how to use the form</li>
<li>check where to send the form</li>
<li>get any contact information for help and advice</li>
<li>sign into the Government Gateway</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
If this applies, you should use a <a href="/patterns-hmrc-govuk-team/forms-publication" class="govuk-link">publication guidance format</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-to-design-using-this-pattern">How to design using this pattern</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="document-type">Document type</h3>

<p class="govuk-body" id="detailed-guide">Detailed guide</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="title">Title</h3>

<p class="govuk-body" id="detailed-guide">
Decide if the title should focus on the action a user needs to take or the name of the form. This will depend on how users will find and navigate to the form.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Try to avoid including the form number. 
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
If there’s a form number, you should include it. For example, ‘Register your business for VAT if you’re distance selling into Northern Ireland using form VAT1A.’
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="body">Body</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="Related guidance">Related guidance</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
Link to any related guidance in a call-to-action box. For example, this guide might explain how to use the form, but there may also be mainstream guidance on eligibility.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="Adding file attachments">Adding file attachments</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
To add a file attachment, use the ‘Embedded attachment’ markdown generated by Whitehall, then using the ‘Copy Markdown’, button paste this at the point that the attachment is needed.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="wales">If the form is applicable in Wales</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the form is applicable in Wales, but is not translated, include the following text:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 'Email HMRC to [ask for the form in Welsh](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/welsh-language-helplines#email).',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<p class="govuk-body">
If the form is translated into Welsh, you do not need to include this, but you must create a Welsh version of the entire page.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ — the attachment must always have the ‘not suitable for assistive technology’ callout.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
You do not need to include a link to the Accessibility Statement for forms in open document formats (odt. and .ods), G-forms or PDFs that you cannot complete on screen.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If there is an interactive guidance form that hosts the other methods of submitting the form, you will not need to include this as it will be in the interactive guidance.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
For any other formats, include the following text under the link to the form:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '^This file may not be suitable if you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader). If you need a more accessible format, email <different.format@hmrc.gov.uk> and tell us what format you need. It will help if you tell us what assistive technology you use. Read the [accessibility statement for HMRC forms](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-statement-for-hmrc-interactive-forms).',

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="formats">How to design for specific form formats</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="gforms">Interactive guidance forms</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
Interactive guidance (IG) forms start with the URL:  https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/guidance.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the interactive guidance form comes after a form asking for Government Gateway credentials, use sub-heading level 3: ‘If you cannot sign in’: 
If it’s the first online form on the guide, use ‘### Complete this form online’
</p>


{{
  codeSnippet({

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="gforms">PDFs that cannot be completed on screen</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These are PDFs the user must print and then complete. They do not require Adobe.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
These do not need any specific instructions for the user.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">

$A ',

<p class="govuk-body">
If the URL includes ‘fill-online’, check the guidance page this links to and avoid any repetition.
