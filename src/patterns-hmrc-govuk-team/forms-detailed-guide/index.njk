<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use this pattern if users need to read detailed guidance before using the form, such as:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>how to use the form</li>
<li>when to use the form</li>
<li>eligibility criteria</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
Before you create the new detailed guide, check if any of the information is already somewhere else, for example in mainstream content or a specialist guide. If it is, do not repeat it, insert a link instead.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Types of form that can be included in this format are: 
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>PDFs that can be completed on-screen (interactive) — these are added as file attachments and require Adobe to open and complete</li>
<li>PDFs that cannot be completed on screen (not interactive) — these are added as file attachments and do not require Adobe to open</li>
<li>LC forms — these are added as external link attachments and the URL will begin with: https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/</li>
<li>G-forms — these are added as external link attachments and the URL will begin with: https://tax.service.gov.uk</li>
<li>forms in open document formats — forms in .ods or odt. format are added as file attachments</li>
<li>KANA forms — these are added as external link attachments and the URL will begin with: https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
More than one type of form can be hosted on the same page. You can still only use the green button once on the page (check the <a href="/patterns-hmrc-govuk-team/green-button/" class="govuk-link">green button pattern</a> for more information). For example: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-bingo-promoter" class="govuk-link">Register as a bingo promoter</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="when-not-to-use">When not to use</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not use this pattern if users do not need to read any detailed guidance before using the form, and only need to:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>check how to use the form</li>
<li>check where to send the form</li>
<li>get any contact information for help and advice</li>
<li>sign into the Government Gateway</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
If this applies, you should use a <a href="/patterns-hmrc-govuk-team/forms-publication" class="govuk-link">publication guidance format</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-to-design-using-this-pattern">How to design using this pattern</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="document-type">Document type</h3>

<p class="govuk-body" id="detailed-guide">Detailed guide</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="title">Title</h3>

<p class="govuk-body" id="detailed-guide">
Decide if the title should focus on the action a user needs to take or the name of the form. This will depend on how users will find and navigate to the form.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Try to avoid including the form number. 
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
If there’s a form number, you should include it. For example, ‘Register your business for VAT if you’re distance selling into Northern Ireland using form VAT1A.’
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="body">Body</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
Link to any related guidance in a call to action box. For example, this guide might explain how to use the form, but there may also be mainstream guidance on eligibility.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
When adding file attachments, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown#publication-box" class="govuk-link">use the publication box !@n markdown in Whitehall</a>. 
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="wales">If the form is applicable in Wales</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the form is applicable in Wales, but is not translated, include the following text:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 'Email HMRC to [ask for the form in Welsh](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/welsh-language-helplines#email).',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<p class="govuk-body">
If the form is translated into Welsh, you do not need to include this, but you must create a Welsh version of the entire page.
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
Do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ — the attachment must always have the ‘not suitable for assistive technology’ callout.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
You do not need to include a link to the Accessibility Statement for forms in open document formats (odt. and .ods), G-forms or PDFs that you cannot complete on screen.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
For any other formats, include the following text under the link to the form:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '^This file may not be suitable if you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader). If you need a more accessible format, email <different.format@hmrc.gov.uk> and tell us what format you need. It will help if you tell us what assistive technology you use. Read the [accessibility statement for HMRC forms](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-statement-for-hmrc-interactive-forms).',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="formats">Specific form formats</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="gforms">PDFs that cannot be completed on screen</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These are PDFs that must be printed before they can be completed. They do not require Adobe.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
These do not need any specific instructions for the user.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the address to send the form is not included on the form itself, include the following text under the link to the form:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '## Where to send the form

$A

$A',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="LC-forms">LC forms</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
These will be hosted on https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
The user will fill these forms online and then print and post them.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Include the following text:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 's1. Get all of your information together before you start. You will fill this form in online and you cannot save your progress.

s2. Fill in [name of form](LINK).

s3. Print and post it to HMRC, using the postal address shown on the form.',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<p class="govuk-body">
If the address to send the form is not included on the form itself, remove ‘using the postal address shown on the form’ from step 3 and include the following text under the steps:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '## Where to send the form

$A

$A ',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<p class="govuk-body">
Check with the subject matter expert if you need to include the following text:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: 'If the form does not open, then [contact the Online services helpdesks for more help](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/online-services-helpdesk).',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="gforms">G-forms (Government Gateway)</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">
G-Forms are hosted on: https://www.tax.service.gov.uk
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
If the URL includes ‘fill-online’, check the guidance page this links to and avoid any repetition.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Depending on the design of the detailed guide, use either an inline link or a <a href="/patterns-hmrc-govuk-team/green-button/" class="govuk-link">green button</a>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
Use the following markdown before linking to the G-form:
</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '## Apply/Register online
You’ll need to either:

* sign in with your Government Gateway user ID and password (if you do not have a user ID, you can create one when you first try to sign in)

* use your email address to get a confirmation code that you can use to sign in
',
      canCopy: true
    })
  }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="PDF">PDF forms that can be completed on-screen</h4>

<p class="govuk-body">Include the following markdown:</p>

{{
    codeSnippet({
      code: '## How to complete the form

You need to:

s1. Download and save the form on your computer.
s2. Open it using the [latest free version of Adobe Reader](http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/).
s3. Complete it on-screen.
