<p class='govuk-body'>Initial caps.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='capitalisation'>capitalisation</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>For general terms, follow the guidance in the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#capitalisation'
class='govuk-link'>GOV.UK style guide</a>. Follow HMRC guidance about the <a href='#capitalisation-of-taxes'
class='govuk-link'>capitalisation of taxes, duties and levies</a>.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>If there is no specific entry about capitalising a term, then use sentence case. For
example:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>limited company</li>
  <li>limited partnership</li>
  <li>sole trader</li>
  <li>employment benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='capitalisation-of-taxes'>capitalisation of taxes, duties and levies</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Always capitalise initial letters when referring to a specific tax, duty or levy by
its full name. For example, Soft Drinks Industry Levy.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>Do not capitalise if you’re referring generally to a:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>tax or taxes</li>
  <li>duty or duties</li>
  <li>levy or levies</li>
  <li>benefit or benefits</li>
</ul>
<p class='govuk-body'>For example, if you say ‘Income Tax’ and later refer to it as ‘tax’, do not
capitalise ‘tax’. Also, do not capitalise groups of things, like ‘alcohol duties’ or ‘tax credits’.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='child-trust-fund'>Child Trust Fund</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Initial caps.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='code-of-practice'>Code of Practice</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Inital caps ‘C’ and ‘P’, lower case ‘o’.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='colons'>colons</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Only use colons:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>to introduce lists</li>
  <li>next to short labels like ‘Telephone:’</li>
</ul>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='complete'>complete</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>See <a class='govuk-link' href='#fill-in'>fill in</a>.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s'>compliance checks</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Lower case, unless referring to a product or process, for example ‘Compliance Checks
learning’ or ‘A New Approach to Compliance Checks’. Try to use informal language like ‘checking your tax
return’ if possible.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='customs-declarations'>Customs declarations</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>When referring to making a declaration use:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>“full import declaration” or “full export declaration”</li>
  <li>“supplementary declaration” – lowercase and do not use “SD”</li>
  <li>“simplified frontier declaration” – lowercase and do not use “SFD”</li>
  <li>“final supplementary declaration” – lowercase</li>
  <li>“pre-shipment advice” – lowercase and do not use “PSA”</li>
  <li>plain English to describe the task for “making an import declaration in your records” or “declaring
     your goods by entering them in your own records” (only use “entry in the declarant’s records” to describe the authorisation to use the customs procedure)</li>
</ul>
<p class='govuk-body'>Do not use “customs declarations”.</p>"

<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='dashes'>dashes</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Dashes separate words into clauses. They are slightly longer than a hyphen and always
have spaces either side of them. For example ‘You can claim the actual amount you’ve spent – you’ll need
to keep receipts.’</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>Dashes usually make sentences more complicated. Before using a dash, or pair of
dashes, consider using separate sentences.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>There are different ways to include a dash in content. You can:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>use option + - key on an Apple Mac</li>
  <li>use alt + 0150 on a PC with a number pad</li>
  <li>copy – into your content</li>
</ul>
<p class='govuk-body'>Avoid the HTML <code>&ampndash;</code> as they are treated differently by different
screen readers.
</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='defined-benefit'>defined benefit</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Lower case.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='defined-contribution'>defined contribution</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Lower case.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='drop-down-menu'>drop-down menu</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>1 hyphen.</p>
<h3 class='govuk-heading-s' id='due'>due, overdue</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Avoid ‘due’ and ‘overdue’ and use plain English instead, for example ‘You need to pay
your return by 31 January 2020’ or ‘Your payment is late’.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>If you need to use them, it should be when a user has to do something by a specific
time or date only. For example, ‘Your payment is due on 31 January 2018’. Do not use them when there is no
specific time or date, for example ‘Your £5,000
is now due’.</p>
