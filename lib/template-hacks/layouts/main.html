<!-- This layout is similar to the templates you'd get in prototypes; 
    it's needed to render the account-header layout. 

    The path of this file relative to lib/template_hacks must match the 
    account-header layout from hmrc-frontend extends. e.g layouts/main.html

    WARNING: there is an account-header template and account-header layout in hmrc-frontend, 
    these are distinct and used by different parts of the prototype kit, 
    please ensure you match the layout one. Sorry for any confusion!
